							//------5. C++ Bitwise Operators-------//
In C++, bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits. They can only be used alongside char and int data types.

Operator	Description
&	        Binary AND
|	        Binary OR
^	        Binary XOR
~	        Binary One's Complement
<<	        Binary Shift Left
>>	        Binary Shift Right


							//-------6. Other C++ Operators------//
Here's a list of some other common operators available in C++. We will learn about them in later tutorials.

Operator	Description	                                                Example

sizeof	    returns the size of data type	                            sizeof(int); // 4
?: 	        returns value based on the condition	                    string result = (5 > 0) ? "even" : "odd"; // "even"
&	        represents memory address of the operand	                &num; // address of num
.	        accesses members of struct variables or class objects	    s1.marks = 92;
->	        used with pointers to access the class or struct variables	ptr->marks = 92;
<<	        prints the output value	                                    cout << 5;
>>	        gets the input value	                                    cin >> num;
